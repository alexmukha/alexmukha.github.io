                            I am a positive individual with a very curious personality. For some, working with computers is not
                            always a fun task but for me it is an enjoyable activity, especially when Iâ€™m getting involved with
                            something that leads me in the depth of the computer code, whether it is a simple HTML or something
                            complex like C++. Recently I have enrolled myself in a coding bootcamp in order to fulfill my
                            long-time desire to grasp the magic behind the mysterious lines of code consisting of many commands
                            with lots of different brackets and other characters. I am very much enjoying attending classes and
                            every time looking forward to attend another one.

                            My other passion is cars. I always try to be on top of the new developments in the automobile
                            industry especially with the way technology is progressing. I consider that a current decade is
                            revolutionary in the vehicle adversity and that we have moved a giant leap in the technology that
                            lets us enjoy the ability to enjoy our personal transportation. And the fact that automobiles are
                            getting suited up with computers makes it that much more interesting for me personally.
