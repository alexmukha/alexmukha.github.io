			<p class="">
				I am a positive individual with a very curious personality. For some, working with computers is not
				always a fun task but for me it is an enjoyable activity, especially when Iâ€™m getting involved with
				something that leads me in the depth of the computer code, whether it is a simple HTML or something
				complex like C++. Recently I have enrolled myself in a coding bootcamp in order to fulfill my
				long-time desire to grasp the magic behind the mysterious lines of code consisting of many commands
				with lots of different brackets and other characters. I am very much enjoying attending classes and
				every time looking forward to attend another one.
			</p>
			<p>
				My other passion is cars. I always try to be on top of the new developments in the automobile
				industry especially with the way technology is progressing. I consider that a current decade is
				revolutionary in the vehicle adversity and that we have moved a giant leap in the technology that
				lets us enjoy the ability to enjoy our personal transportation. And the fact that automobiles are
				getting suited up with computers makes it that much more interesting for me personally.
